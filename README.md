# MarsExplorer

This is a mars rover program where we have to navigate the rover based on user inputs and find the final position.

Inputs:

      eg: 5,5
      
-> Initial rover position and direction (X, Y, [N,S,E,W]) 
      
      eg: (1,2,E) will be the rover at 1,2 and facing east.
      
-> Series of instructions 
      
      eg: L (turn left), R (turn right), M (move 1 blobk)

Output:
